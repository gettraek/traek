# Introduction

Træk (`traek`) is a Svelte 5 UI library for building **spatial, tree-structured AI conversation interfaces**.

Instead of the traditional linear chat UI, Træk renders messages as **nodes on a pannable/zoomable canvas** with full branching support. Users can explore multiple conversation branches, compare responses, and navigate complex AI interactions visually.

## Key Features

- **Spatial Canvas** — Pan and zoom through your conversation history
- **Tree Branching** — Fork any message to explore different paths
- **Streaming Support** — Real-time token streaming with visual feedback
- **Keyboard Navigation** — Full keyboard shortcuts for power users
- **Mobile Ready** — Touch gestures, swipe navigation, focus mode
- **Dark Theme** — Beautiful dark-first design with CSS custom properties
- **Extensible** — Custom node types and component overrides

## When to Use Træk

Træk is ideal for:

- AI coding assistants with complex multi-turn conversations
- Research tools that benefit from branching exploration
- AI agent interfaces that need to visualize decision trees
- Any application where conversation history is a first-class citizen
